# Quantum PDE Simulation

Welcome! This repository contains my student project for simulating quantum partial differential equations (PDEs) using Python. The goal is to learn about quantum systems, numerical methods, and how to visualize results. If you’re a fellow student or just curious, feel free to explore or use any part of it!

## What is this project?

This repository contains simple Python scripts and tools to experiment with quantum circuits and PDEs. It’s designed as a learning project. You’ll find source code to run simulations, folders for saving your results, and some documentation to help you understand what’s happening.

## Project Structure

- **src/**  
  Contains the main Python code for running the quantum PDE simulation.
  - [`quantum_pde_simulation.py`](https://github.com/YoussefSah05/quantum-pde-simulation/blob/main/src/quantum_pde_simulation.py): The main script for building and running quantum PDE simulations.

- **graphs/**  
  This folder holds the result graphs and images generated by the simulation or used to illustrate the concepts.  
  Some files you’ll find here:
    - [Fourier_Circuit.jpg](https://github.com/YoussefSah05/quantum-pde-simulation/blob/main/graphs/Fourier_Circuit.jpg)
    - [The_Hadamard-CNOT_transform_on_the_zero-state.png](https://github.com/YoussefSah05/quantum-pde-simulation/blob/main/graphs/The_Hadamard-CNOT_transform_on_the_zero-state.png)
    - ...and more!

- **docs/**  
  This folder contains the documentation and reports for the project.  
  - [`Quantum_PDE_Project_Report_v1.pdf`](https://github.com/YoussefSah05/quantum-pde-simulation/blob/main/docs/Quantum_PDE_Project_Report_v1.pdf): The main project report. This document explains what the project is about, the methods used, and the results. If you want to understand the theory and workflow behind the code, start here!
  - [`Quantum_PDE_Project_Appendix.pdf`](https://github.com/YoussefSah05/quantum-pde-simulation/blob/main/docs/Quantum_PDE_Project_Appendix.pdf): The appendix contains additional explanations, details, and background information that support the report. Check this out for extra context or deeper dives into some concepts.

## How to use the project

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YoussefSah05/quantum-pde-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Open the code**  
   Go to the `src/` folder and open `quantum_pde_simulation.py`. You’ll need Python 3.x to run it.

3. **Run a simulation**  
   Run the script from your terminal or IDE. Generated results will appear in the `graphs/` folder.

4. **Read the docs**  
   If you want more details or explanations, check out the PDF reports in the `docs/` folder:
   - The **report** covers the main ideas, steps, and results.
   - The **appendix** adds extra theory and explanations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Qiskit
